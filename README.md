# Paper Game Bots
by Matt Young.

These are some bots, written in Kotlin, that play various "paper games": card games, tabletop games, etc. I made
them for fun as a project to work on when I'm bored.

## Contents
- guanpai: A bot that plays the Chinese shedding-style card game _guan pai_ (similar to Presidents). Uses Monte-Carlo
simulation to account for imperfect information
- hangman: A bot that plays hangman. You know the one. Uses a simple but surprisingly effective dictionary search on
an absolutely enormous dictionary file.
